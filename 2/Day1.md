# Day 1: Resource Integration preparation and initiation

During this first day of the biohackathon.

- We have created an APICURON [submission Client](#Submission-Client) 


## Submission Client

The Submission Client is a UI component that is part of APICURON that allows Curation Databases to beta-test their APICURON integration making it simpler for them to test APICURON prior and during their integration process.

## Document Versioning

We noticed a common problem among curation databases when it comes to versioning their data and building a history of the updates made to it.
This leads to issues for these databases when it comes to tracking their curation efforts as previous contributions might be overwritten by new ones.

Therefore we're starting to work on a System to build and maintain History versions of Generic Data (think of it like a version system for database content). available [here](https://github.com/Quickinline/mongodb-versioner)

## Documentation authoring

APICURON needs a more accessible documentation to allow people to use it without necessarily needing a direct human interation with our team members.

Therefore we're working on setting up a good documentation for APICURON to help Curation Platforms integrate far easier.
